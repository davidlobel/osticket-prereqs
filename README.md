<p>
Begin by creating a Resource Group (RG) in Microsoft Azure Cloud Service. A resource group is a centralized location (logical container) for a collection of resources with a unified lifecycle. For simplicity, we can think of a Resource Group as being similar to folder on a computer that houses files in one central location. When provisioning a Resource Group you will need to select a region. Regions are physical locations where your virtual resources will be warehoused on physical servers in data centers.
  
Be sure to note what region you select, as this will be important in creating future instances.

<p>
Create a Virtual Machine (VM) in your newly created Resource Group. A VM is a self-selected allocation of compute resources (OS, CPU, etc.) stored on a data center server, which you will be able to access from anywhere in the world via the internet. You will need to ensure that the region matches that of the Resource Group which you selected in the previous step. For this example I will be using a Windows 10 operating system with 4vCPUs. Name this machine, create a username and password, and make note of these credentials as they will be necessary to log in to this resource in the same manner that you would log in to your physical desktop or laptop machine.

Once you are satisfied with your selections, create your resource. 
  
Before moving on, be sure to make note of the public IP address for this VM.
